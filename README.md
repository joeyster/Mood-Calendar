## Inspiration
A mood calendar an aesthetically pleasing and simplistic way of journaling. Some days you feel happy and other days you feel sad. Through journaling and tracking your mood, a mood calendar helps one's mental health by noticing patterns. Being able to see your negative feelings rack up for consecutive days and help you look for a change. On the other hand, seeing multiple happiness days can be joyous to see. Ultimately, is it aesthetically pleasing if a mobile app for mood calendars is plastered with ads? No. That's why I wanted to create my own and at the same time, share it with the community. Mental health is an important aspect of life; if there's a chance that having a mood calendar can help, I'm glad I spent the time for make Moody.
## What it does
Moody – Mood Calendar is a free and easy to use app that let’s you track down your
mood everyday in your personal calendar. With a simple and easy to navigate interface,
inputting your mood takes no more than a few seconds to do, and having a monthly and
yearly view makes looking at all the mood so far nice and hassle free. Choose a color
each day based on your mood and Moody will track it down, letting you view how
positive or how negative you have been feeling lately. Comes with five different colors
for different moods. Also included are options to clear out the mood for the day or all the
mood so far in the settings button. There is also an overview button that let’s you see an
entire year worth of mood in one page.
## How I built it
Moody - Mood Calendar was built with Xcode, using Swift as its coding language. Using iOS fundamental design practices and concepts (such as MVC, Auto Layout, Segues, and more), I was able to create my first mobile app!
